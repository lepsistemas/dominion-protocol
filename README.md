# Dominion Protocol

**Dominion Protocol** is a strategic, modular card-based war game built in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using C#.  
It blends classic territorial conquest gameplay with deep customization and community-driven expansion.

> The world is unstable. Treaties have failed. New threats emerge.  
> The protocol has been activated.

## üïπ Game Concept

- Turn-based warfare inspired by *Risk/WAR*
- Each player controls a nation and seeks to dominate neighbors
- Game actions are driven by a deck of strategic cards
- Players will eventually be able to create their own cards, rules, and visual styles
- Fully moddable game engine prepared for online custom matches
- Future goal: multiplayer support via socket server with game IDs

> The long-term vision is to build not just a game, but a **platform** for custom card-based world domination.
