# Dominion Protocol

**Dominion Protocol** is a strategic card-based war game built in [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using C#.
It blends classic territorial conquest gameplay with dynamic, AI-driven global events.

> The world is unstable. Treaties have failed. New threats emerge.  
> The protocol has been activated.

## 🕹 Game Concept

- Turn-based warfare inspired by *Risk/WAR*
- Each player controls a nation and seeks to dominate neighbors
- Game actions are driven by a deck of strategic cards
- Unexpected global events (e.g. disasters, revolts, economic crashes) generated via AI
- Scalable system for DLCs (e.g. alien invasions, AI singularity)

---

## 🎯 Tech Stack

- **Engine**: [Godot 4.x](https://godotengine.org/)
- **Language**: C# 11
- **Architecture**: MVP (Model-View-Presenter) + Clean Use Cases
- **Tests**: NUnit + Moq
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI (GPT-4 or compatible) via API
